<h3>Project Overview:</h3>

Quiz Application, where a user can enter their name and select from pre-defined categories and difficulties. Their high scores are recorded and show the outcome of their answer. The user will have 10 seconds per question to answer. The score will be rendered at the end of the quiz with a different message depending on outcome of the score.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

- React
- useContext
- Uses external API for quiz data
- Styled-components
- MUI

<h3>Notes</h3>

- React was chosen because I aim to become a junior react developer and for its capabilities and ui development.
- For the CSS, it is a mixture of styled-components and MUI. It was outside the scope of this project to configure CRA / styled-components / MUI to work together.
- useContext was used for state management. This project aimed at learning useContext ordinarly I would of handeld this state differently.
